Problem
The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Solution
def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    # Write your logic here
    if (year % 4 == 0):
        if (year % 100 == 0):
            if (year % 400 == 0):
                return True
            elif (year % 400 != 0):
                return False
        elif (year % 100 != 0):
            return True
    
    return leap

year = int(input())
